            We can know Ajju bhai, Amit bhai, Gyan Sujan Etc. But they are running their channel using their voice cover or fun or giveaway.

            But Ankush is a legendary player like Mina server players B2k, BNL, Stylus. I love his gameplay very much.

            Anyway, Ankushâ€™s real name is Ankush Tripathi & his nationality is Indian. And this season he is now on Grandmaster Top 1. This season he is pushing with his friends on squad.
